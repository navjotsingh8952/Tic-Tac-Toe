# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

## Overview
Tic-Tac-Toe is a classic two-player game where players take turns marking Xs and Os on a 3x3 grid. The goal is to get three of your marks in a row, column, or diagonal before your opponent.

This game is developed in C using the `conio` and `dos` libraries to handle graphics and game mechanics.

## Features

- **Simple and Interactive UI**: Built using C's built-in libraries.
- **Win Detection**: The game detects when a player wins or if thereâ€™s a draw.
- **Undo & Reset Options**: Players can reset the game or undo moves.

## Installation & Execution
1. **Compile the Game**: Use a C compiler that supports `conio.h` and `dos.h`, such as Turbo C++.
2. **Run the Executable**: After compilation, execute the game in a DOS-compatible environment or an emulator like DOSBox.

## Controls
